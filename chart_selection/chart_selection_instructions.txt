R Script IDENTIFY_POTENTIAL_CHARTS_AND_SAVE_MASTER.R:

	calcualtes sharpe ratios
	finds non-overlapping charts for each sharpe block
	saves data in CHART_MASTER.csv

R Script MAKE_CHART_SERIES_FROM_MASTER.R:
	reads CHART_MASTER.csv and SERIES_PRICE.csv
	randomly chooses 20 charts from each sharpe block
	saves CHART_SERIES.csv with slightly modified price data so participants cannot guess chart

R Script MODIFY_CHART_SERIES_FOR_UNIQUE_ID.R:
